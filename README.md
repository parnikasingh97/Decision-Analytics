In this section, an attempt has been made to mitigate the gender bias in predicting defaulters and non-defaulters for loans. The classic regression models predict that women are more prone to defaulting leading to unfair models. Methods like regularization, custom lambda in regularization, demographic parity, and equal opportunity has been used to make the regression model fair. 

Furthermore, an example of linear programming and decision making has been provided using Gurobi in Python.
